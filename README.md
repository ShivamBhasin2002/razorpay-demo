# razorpay-demo

To run the app on your localhost:

- create a razopay account and from settings take the test api key and secret.
- create an .env file in the backend and the frontend folder and save those details there.
- after that run the backend folder using the command `node index.js` and the frontend using `npm start` simultaneously.
- wallah you are all done.
